E-commerce Sales Data Visualization
A data analysis project focused on extracting business insights from e-commerce sales records using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

📊 Project Highlights
This project analyzes how factors like Product Placement, Promotions, and Material Type influence sales performance. Since the dataset was well-structured, the focus was on advanced data aggregation and high-impact visualization.

🛠️ Skills & Tools
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy

Environment: VS Code

Techniques: Data Aggregation (groupby, transform), Metric Calculation (Revenue), and Statistical Plotting.

📈 Insights & Visualizations
The script generates several key visualizations to drive business decisions:

Promotion Impact (Bar Chart): Compares the mean sales volume to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

Product Positioning (Pie Chart): Visualizes the share of sales coming from different store locations (Aisle, End-cap, Front of Store).

Revenue Distribution (Histogram): Shows the spread of total revenue generated across the entire product catalog.

Material Value (Line Plot): Tracks the total price value of products grouped by material (Cotton, Polyester, etc.).
